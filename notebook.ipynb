    "Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction.\n",

    "The RMSE metric on the test set should not be more than 48.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Download the data and resample it by one hour.\n",
    "2. Analyze the data.\n",
    "3. Train different models with different hyperparameters. The test sample should be 10% of the initial dataset. \n",

    "This is a seasonal decomposition of time series plot, which breaks data into four components: Observed, Trend, Seasonal, and Residual. Among those four, the first one is Observed which is the original time series data (num_orders) over time. With noticable spikes and fluctuations, one can see an overall increasing trend. Second graph is trend - the long-term movement in the data. A clear upward movement can be seen showing that the number of orders is gradually increasing over time. Third one is seasonal graph which shows the repeating patterns in the data. Here a strong seasonality, with regular and periodic fluctuations can be seen. Also it has repetitive tightly packed patterns representing daily seasonlity. Lastly, the fourth one is residual graphs which shows random fluctuations remaining after removing the trend and seasonlity. Here the residuals shows some varaibility with larger deviations towards the end representing some splikes in the dataset. "

    "The above ACF plot shows the correlation between the time series and its lagged values. The x-axis represents the lags (time steps) and the y-axis represents the autocorrelation coefficient. The first bar at lag 0 is always 1 showing the prefect correlation with itself. The repeated spikes at regualar intervals suggesting periodic patterns over time. The shaded region represents the confidence interval and correlations outside this region are considered statiscally significant.\n",

    "The above PACF plot shows the direct correlation between the time series and its lagged values. This helps in identifying the order of the autoregression (AR) term when fitting ARIMA models. The x-axis represents the lags, and the y-axis represents the partial autocorrelaton coefficient. Just like ACF graph, in PACF graph the first bar at lag is always 1, indicating perfect correlation with itself. The next few bars which are outside the shaded region shows statistically significant correlations suggesting the most relevant logs. "

    "RMSE of Linear Regression model on test set is 53.62 which suggests that Linear Regression cannot capture the non-linear relationships and seasonlity in the data. The RMSE on the test set (53.62) is significantly higher than the RMSE on the training set (30.21). The large difference between the training and test set RMSE indicates that the Linear Regression model is overfitting. This can be seen as the training RMSE of 30.21 shows that the model fits the training data quite well but the test RMSE of 53.21 reveals that the model struggles with new data, indicasting poor generalization. Thus, it makes it a poor choice for time series forecasting. "

The relatively small difference between the training and test RMSE indicates that the LGBM model generalizes well, with only slight overfitting. The test RMSE is slightly higher than training RMSE indicating that the model does not overly memorize the training data and can effectively generalize to unseen data.

    "For the Random Forest Regression model, the test RMSE (43.87) is higher than the training RMSE (40.40), but the difference is minimal. The minimal difference between the training and test RMSE indicates that the Random Forest model generalizes well as it performs consistently with both training and test sets. The test RMSE is slightly higher than training RMSE indicating that the model is not overfitting and captures the underlying patterns effectively. This also demonstrates that the model is stable and robust to new data, making it highly reliable for forecasting. Thus, Random Forest achieves the lowest RMSE on the test set, making it the best-performing model. "

Lastly, ARMA performed slightly worse than AR, but better than MA with an RMSE of 49.74. Thus, making AR the best model among the classical time series models. \n",
