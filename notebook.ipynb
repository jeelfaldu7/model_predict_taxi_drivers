    "## Introduction\n",
    "Sweet Lift Taxi wants to make sure there are enough drivers available during busy times, especially near airports. To help with this, the company plans to predict how many taxi orders will happen in the next hour. If they can know when demand will be high, they can ask more drivers to be ready, which will help both the passengers and the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will use historical data from the file taxi.csv, which shows how many taxi orders were made at different times. Our goal is to build a model that can predict the number of orders one hour in advance. We will measure how well our model works using a metric called RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and our goal is to keep this number below 48 on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we will do in the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the data so that it's grouped by one-hour time periods.\n",
    "2. Look at the data to understand patterns and trends.\n",
    "3. Train different machine learning models and test different settings to see what works best.\n",
    "4. Test the final model on new data and see how accurate it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, we hope to build a tool that helps Sweet Lift Taxi predict demand more accurately and improve their service during busy times."

    "This is a seasonal decomposition of time series plot, which breaks data into four components: Observed, Trend, Seasonal, and Residual. Among those four, the first one is Observed which is the original time series data (num_orders) over time. With noticable spikes and fluctuations, one can see an overall increasing trend. Second graph is trend - the long-term movement in the data. A clear upward movement can be seen showing that the number of orders is gradually increasing over time. Third one is seasonal graph which shows the repeating patterns in the data. Here a strong seasonality, with regular and periodic fluctuations can be seen. Also it has repetitive tightly packed patterns representing daily seasonlity. Lastly, the fourth one is residual graphs which shows random fluctuations remaining after removing the trend and seasonlity. Here the residuals shows some varaibility with larger deviations towards the end representing some splikes in the dataset. "

The x-axis represents the lags, and the y-axis represents the partial autocorrelaton coefficient. Just like ACF graph, in PACF graph the first bar at lag is always 1, indicating perfect correlation with itself. The next few bars which are outside the shaded region shows statistically significant correlations suggesting the most relevant logs. "

    "RMSE measures the average error magnitude between the predicted and actual ones. An RMSE of 48.34 means on average this model's predictions deviate by approximately 48 orders from the actual orders. Since the 'num_orders' values range from 0 to 432, an RMSE of 48 seems relatively high which indicates that while the model captures the trend snd seasonlity to some  extent there is still a considerable amount of error."

The test RMSE is slightly higher than training RMSE indicating that the model is not overfitting and captures the underlying patterns effectively.

Among all time series models, autoregression model performed the best with an RMSE of 48.34, while moving average has the worst performances with an RMSE of 84.64 indicating it is not effective for this data. Lastly, ARMA performed slightly worse than AR, but better than MA with an RMSE of 49.74. Thus, making AR the best model among the classical time series models. \n",

Following this, CatBoost model generalized well, but LGBM slightly outperformed it, achieving a lower RMSE on the test set. Lastly, Random Forest was the best performer overall,  with the lowest RMSE of 43.87, and excellent generalization. The minimal difference between training and test set RMSE representing no overfitting and making it highly reliable for production use. \n"
